# AI Speech Assistant

This project is a conversational AI-powered speech assistant that uses Whisper for speech-to-text conversion and Llama for natural language understanding. The assistant can process your voice input, detect emotions, provide intelligent responses, and even speak the responses back to you using a natural-sounding voice.

## Features:
- **Speech-to-text conversion** using Whisper.
- **Natural language processing** with Llama.
- **Emotion detection** to provide context-aware responses.
- **Text-to-speech responses** with customizable voice options.
